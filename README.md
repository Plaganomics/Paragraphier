### Example Text

Sometimes good paragraphing is as simple as letting the start of one paragraph serve as the conclusion to the last, leaving readers hanging for half a beat. 
Raffi Khatchadourian does this in his essay “The Taste Makers,” writing about the flavor industry.  Khatchadourian tells readers about the confidentiality 
agreements that makers of food flavorings sign. The paragraph ends with an example of a company honoring the agreement even years later. Asked about their 
flavor development for Snapple, the Brooklyn-based flavoring company Virginia Dare “refused to discuss the matter.” The next paragraph opens with the broader 
point: “Such secrecy helps shape the story of our food.”  Had Khatchadourian ended his previous paragraph with that line, 
it would be a flat summary. At the beginning of the next paragraph, however, it sets the trajectory for the next part of the essay.
